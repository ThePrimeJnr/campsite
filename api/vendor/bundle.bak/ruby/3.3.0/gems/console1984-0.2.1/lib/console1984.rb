# = Console 1984
#
# Console1984 is an IRB-based Rails console extension that does
# three things:
#
# * Record console sessions with their user, reason and commands.
# * Protect encrypted data by showing the ciphertexts when you visualize it.
# * Protect access to external systems that contain sensitive information (such as Redis
#   or Elasticsearch).
#
# == Session logging
#
# The console will record the session, its user and the commands entered. The logic to
# persist sessions is handled by the configured session logger, which is
# Console1984::SessionsLogger::Database by default.
#
# == Execution of commands
#
# The console will work in two modes:
#
# * Protected: It won't show encrypted information (it will show the ciphertexts instead)
#   and it won't allow connections to protected urls.
# * Unprotected: it allows access to encrypted information and protected urls. The commands
#   executed in this mode as flagged as sensitive.
#
# Console1984::CommandExecutor handles the execution of commands applying the corresponding
# protection mechanisms.Â´
#
# == Internal tampering prevention
#
# Finally, console1984 includes protection mechanisms against internal tampering while using
# the console. For example, to prevent the user from deleting audit trails. See
# Console1984::Shield and Console1984::CommandValidator to learn more.
